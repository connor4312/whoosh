# Whoosh

Collapses a Python project tree, and does its best to fix any imports you have. Seems to work pretty well. Doesn't modify existing files, copies them into a new target directory.

Experiment learning Ruby. Uses global variables, probably breaks every code convention ever made. Don't hate.

### Usage:

```sh
 $ ruby <source_directory> <target_directory>
```
